## Common errors

Oh NO, an error occured. Don't worry, There are a few common bugs that are hard to fix.
but easy to walk around
1. Only use letters and numbers. No spaces or dashes, this can easily break the code
2. Don't spam click on the buttons! Autohotkey is not made for speed, but for ease of use and reliability.
3. Don't edit the settings.ini file. If you wan't to change the mod install location. Just delete the file
